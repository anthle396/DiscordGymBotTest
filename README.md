## Section 1: Introduction

### Introduction/Inspiration
The purpose of creating this bot was that me and my friend were always like why isn't there a bot on discord that tracks your gym statistics and as gym heads and coders we decided that it was time for that to change. I did not want to use my own computer to host this bot so I found a site called repl.it that acts as a cloud drive/ide that will run, compile, and store my code. I did some more research and figured out that I can make it run 24/7 using another site called uptime.com that would monitor the website and did some research on the syntax that discord uses to code in Python. I did not really know much about storing databases so I asked a friend how I would do it and since he had taken a class where he used .txt databases he said I should just go with that. 
*Note: This is not for any professional use or anything so there are some possiblilties of bugs and not as pretty looking.*

### Section 2: How It Works

### Description
This bot utilizes python to store gym personal records and displays them on discord for you to track and see eachother on the leaderboard. So far the leaderboard is on all servers that the bot is on since the database is not on a per server basis.
